# Parallelization

## Overview

Parallelization executes multiple independent operations concurrently instead of sequentially. Rather than waiting for one task to complete before starting the next, parallel execution runs independent tasks simultaneously, significantly reducing total execution time.

The core principle is identifying workflow components that don't depend on each other's outputs and executing them in parallel. This is especially effective with external services (APIs, databases) that have inherent latency - you can issue multiple requests concurrently and process all responses together.

**Example:** A content generation system needs to create a blog title, meta description, social post, and hashtags. Sequential execution takes 8 seconds (2 seconds × 4 tasks). Parallel execution runs all four simultaneously, completing in ~2 seconds total - a 4× speedup.

**Benefits:**
- Dramatic reduction in total execution time (often 3-5× faster)
- Better resource utilization (maximize throughput)
- Improved user experience (faster responses)
- Scalable performance (easily add more parallel operations)

## How It Works

```
                    ┌─→ Task 1 (2s) ─┐
                    │                 │
Input → Parallelize ├─→ Task 2 (2s) ─┤→ Combine → Output
                    │                 │
                    └─→ Task 3 (2s) ─┘

Sequential: 6 seconds total
Parallel:   2 seconds total (3× speedup)
```

## Example

The example implements a content generation system comparing execution approaches:
1. **Sequential approach** - Generate title → meta → social → hashtags (one at a time)
2. **Parallel approach** - Generate all four pieces simultaneously using `asyncio.gather()`
3. **Performance comparison** - Display timing difference and speedup factor

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify independent tasks** - Find operations that don't depend on each other's outputs
2. **Create async chains** - Build LangChain chains that support async execution
3. **Use asyncio.gather()** - Execute multiple `.ainvoke()` calls concurrently
4. **Combine results** - Collect and process all outputs together

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- Multiple tasks are independent (no dependencies between them)
- Tasks involve I/O operations (API calls, database queries)
- You're dealing with external services that have latency
- Total execution time is a performance bottleneck

**Avoid when:**
- Tasks depend on each other's outputs (must run sequentially)
- Operations are CPU-bound rather than I/O-bound
- You only have a single task to execute
- The overhead of parallelization exceeds the benefit
