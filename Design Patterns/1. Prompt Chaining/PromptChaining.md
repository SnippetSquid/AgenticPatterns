# Prompt Chaining

## Overview
Prompt chaining, sometimes referred to as Pipeline pattern, represents a powerful paradigm
for handling intricate tasks when leveraging large language models (LLMs). Rather than
expecting an LLM to solve a complex problem in a single, monolithic step, prompt chaining
advocates for a divide-and-conquer strategy. The core idea is to break down the original,
daunting problem into a sequence of smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each
sub-problem is addressed individually through a specifically designed prompt, and the output
generated from one prompt is strategically fed as input into the subsequent prompt in the
chain.

This sequential processing technique inherently introduces modularity and clarity into the
interaction with LLMs. By decomposing a complex task, it becomes easier to understand and
debug each individual step, making the overall process more robust and interpretable. Each
step in the chain can be meticulously crafted and optimized to focus on a specific aspect of the
larger problem, leading to more accurate and focused outputs.

The output of one step acting as the input for the next is crucial. This passing of information
establishes a dependency chain, hence the name, where the context and results of previous
operations guide the subsequent processing. This allows the LLM to build on its previous work,
refine its understanding, and progressively move closer to the desired solution.
Furthermore, prompt chaining is not just about breaking down problems; it also enables the
integration of external knowledge and tools. At each step, the LLM can be instructed to interact
with external systems, APIs, or databases, enriching its knowledge and abilities beyond its
internal training data. This capability dramatically expands the potential of LLMs, allowing them
to function not just as isolated models but as integral components of broader, more intelligent
systems.

The significance of prompt chaining extends beyond simple problem-solving. It serves as a
foundational technique for building sophisticated AI agents. These agents can utilize prompt
chains to autonomously plan, reason, and act in dynamic environments. By strategically
structuring the sequence of prompts, an agent can engage in tasks requiring multi-step
reasoning, planning, and decision-making. Such agent workflows can mimic human thought
processes more closely, allowing for more natural and effective interactions with complex
domains and systems.

The Role of Structured Output: The reliability of a prompt chain is highly dependent on the
integrity of the data passed between steps. If the output of one prompt is ambiguous or poorly
formatted, the subsequent prompt may fail due to faulty input. To mitigate this, specifying a
structured output format, such as JSON or XML, is crucial.

**Benefits:**
- Better quality (focused subtasks)
- Easier debugging (inspect intermediate outputs)
- More control (validate/modify between steps)

## How It Works

```
Input → Prompt 1 → LLM → Output 1 → Prompt 2 → LLM → Output 2 → ...
```

## Example

The example chains three prompts:
1. Product description → Product name
2. Product name → Marketing slogan
3. Name + slogan → Full description

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create individual prompts** - Define each step as a separate prompt template
2. **Build chains** - Combine prompt → LLM → output parser using the pipe operator (`|`)
3. **Execute sequentially** - Run each chain, passing outputs to the next chain's inputs

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- Tasks can be broken into logical steps
- You need to validate outputs between steps
- Different steps need different prompting strategies

**Avoid when:**
- Task is simple and single-step
- Latency is critical (chains = multiple API calls)
